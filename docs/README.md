# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

Welcome — this README is the primary entry point for OctoAcme's project management documentation. It summarizes our approach, core principles, lifecycle, roles, cadence, and links to the canonical process docs in this repository.

## Purpose
Make project management processes easy to find and use:
- Help new team members onboard quickly
- Provide a single source of truth for program processes
- Encourage consistent, repeatable delivery and continuous improvement

## Summary of OctoAcme Project Management Processes
OctoAcme favors an iterative, customer-centered approach with clear ownership and a regular cadence of planning, delivery, review, and learning.

Core principles
- Customer-first: prioritize value and usability
- Iterative, incremental delivery: small testable increments
- Clear ownership and communication: named PM and Product Lead per project
- Data-informed decisions: define metrics and iterate based on evidence
- Psychological safety: encourage candid feedback and learning

Project lifecycle (high level)
1. Initiation — validate need, align stakeholders, create a Project One-pager
2. Planning — define scope, backlog, estimates, milestones, and risks
3. Execution — implement, test, review, and iterate
4. Release — deploy, verify, and communicate
5. Retrospective & Close — capture learnings and continuous improvements

Core roles
- Product Manager (PdM) — defines outcomes, success metrics, and prioritization
- Project Manager (PM) — coordinates delivery, schedule, risks, and communication
- Developers — design, build, and test features
- QA/Testing — validate acceptance criteria and quality
- Stakeholders / Sponsors — provide inputs, approvals, and priorities

Communication cadence & practices
- Daily standups (team-level) for progress and blockers
- Weekly PM + PdM sync and weekly delivery syncs for cross-team coordination
- Regular demos at the end of sprints or milestones
- Monthly stakeholder updates and ad-hoc escalations when needed
- Use project boards and a single source of truth for status
